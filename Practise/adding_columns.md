# Practice: Adding Columns in Wireshark

Wireshark allows you to customize the packet list view by adding columns for any field you want to monitor closely. This helps you analyze traffic more efficiently.

## Easy Method

1. In the **Packet Details** pane (middle pane), right-click the field you want to add as a column (e.g., `ip.src`, `tcp.dstport`).
2. Select **Apply as Column**.
3. The new column appears immediately in the packet list.
